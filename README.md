# HTTP Scavenger Hunt

A curriculum experiment for DBC Phase 2 Day 1--students learn HTTP through a step-by-step scavenger hunt. They must perform HTTP requests manually over a TCP connection created using netcat (`nc`), with each response providing clues for the next.

This "experiment" has been core curriculum for a while. It is deployed and playable [here](http://dbcapps.com/).

Ellie came up with the original concept, and Matt refined it further. This project started out as a Sinatra port of some [initial work](https://github.com/mattbaker/http-explorer) Matt did in Phoenix/Elixir, but we're diverging and taking it further to make it ready for a delivery experiment.
