Success!

It's time to move on to level 3, however, we've heard that page is expecting a password.

The good news is, we know the password: "helloHTTP".
The bad news is, we don't know how to send the password!

This might be a good time to look at HTTP query parameters...

You'll find Level 3 at: <%= levels_path @conn, :level_3 %>
