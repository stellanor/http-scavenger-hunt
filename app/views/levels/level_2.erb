<p>It's time to move on to level 3, however, we've heard that we need to know a secret password to get in.</p>

<p>
    We know the server is looking for a parameter called "secret", and the secret
    is "<%= LEVEL_3_SECRET %>". But how do we send it?
</p>
<p>
    This might be a good time to look at HTTP query parameters.
</p>

<p>You'll find Level 3 at: "<%= level_path 3 %>"</p>
