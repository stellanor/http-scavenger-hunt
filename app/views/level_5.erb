<h2>Welcome to Level 5</h2>
<p>Welcome! To continue past level 5, you'll need to register a new user with our site so you can log in to Level 6.</p>
<h2>Time to learn about POST requests</h2>
<p>So far you've been making GET requests, but GET requests are mostly for <em>receiving</em> data. Sometimes you need to <em>send</em> data to the server, like when you send a username and password to a website to register a new account.</p>
<p>To send data to a server, we typically use a POST request. If you send a correctly formatted POST request to <code>/users</code> on this webserver you'll be able to register a new account. The most common way to issue a POST request to a webserver is an HTML form, but we're going to do it by hand.</p>
<p>To do this you'll need a few things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>You need to use POST, not GET, in your request line (the first line).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Since you're sending content to the server now, you need to tell the server what format your content will be using.</p>
        <p>Use the header <code>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> to tell the server that you're sending data in the same format a web form would.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Since you're sending content, you'll also need to tell the webserver how many characters you're sending. Use the <code>Content-Length: LENGTH</code> header where LENGTH is the number of characters you're sending.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The actual data you want to send will be in the body of the request. In a POST request, this is after the blank line.</p>
        <p>Since we're using the "www-form-urlencoded"[1] format, your data should be in the form <code>key=value&amp;key2=value2</code>.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a hypothetical POST request where we post a new tweet to Twitter:</p>
<pre><code>POST /status HTTP/1.1
Host: twitter.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 16

tweet=helloworld
</code></pre>
<h2>Registering a User</h2>
<p>To register a new user, send a POST request to <code>/users</code>. The server is expecting you to include two things in the data you send, "username" and "password". If you send the POST correctly you'll get back a response telling you you registered succesfully, along with the URL of Level 6.</p>
