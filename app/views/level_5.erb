## Welcome to Level 5

Welcome! To continue past level 5, you'll need to register a new user with our site
so you can log in to Level 6.

## Time to learn about POST requests

So far you've been making GET requests, but GET requests are mostly for _receiving_
data. Sometimes you need to _send_ data to the server, like when you send
a username and password to a website to register a new account.

To send data to a server, we typically use a POST request. If you send a correctly
formatted POST request to "/users" on this webserver you'll be able to register a
new account. The most common way to issue a POST request to a webserver is an HTML
form, but we're going to do it by hand.

To do this you'll need a few things:

 * You need to use POST, not GET, in your request line (the first line).

 * Since you're sending content to the server now, you need to tell the server
   what format your content will be using.

   Use the header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" to tell the
   server that you're sending data in the same format a web form would.

 * Since you're sending content, you'll also need to tell the webserver how many
   characters you're sending. Use the "Content-Length: LENGTH" header where LENGTH
   is the number of characters you're sending.

 * The actual data you want to send will be in the body of the request. In a POST
   request, this is after the blank line.

   Since we're using the "www-form-urlencoded"[1] format, your data should be in
   the form key=value&key2=value2.


Here's a hypothetical POST request where we post a new tweet to Twitter:

  POST /status HTTP/1.1
  Host: twitter.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Content-Length: 16

  tweet=helloworld

## Registering a User

To register a new user, send a POST request to /users. The server is expecting you
to include two things in the data you send, "username" and "password". If you send
the POST correctly you'll get back a response telling you you registered succesfully,
along with the URL of Level 6.
