Ah, you made it! As you probably observed, you didn't get a 200 OK response when
you visited <%= levels_path(@conn, :level_4) %>. You saw a 301 response.

The 301 response you saw is known as a _redirect_. A redirect doesn't send
you any data, it just gives you a new URL to visit in the "Location" header.
It looks like you found that header, because you ended up here!

You'll find level 5 at <%= levels_path(@conn, :level_5) %>.
